HZ Announce
=========

[HZ Announce](http://hzannounce.com) can be used to broadcast the public key of a new account.
It will also send 2 HZ for the first transactions.

The current implementation will always render a success message, even if the data entered is invalid.
Result is logged to javascript console.
It also strangely allows the visitor to edit the whole page. That's neat, but probably not intentional.


Frontend created with Minimal Form Interface

A simplistic form with inputs shown one at a time. Inspired by the form seen on the end of the [PageLanes website](http://www.pagelanes.com/).
